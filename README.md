# [PilotZ](http://p112.sourceforge.net/index.php?pilotz) interpreter

This is a simple Pilot interpreter for Z80 that I wrote many years ago. 
Nothing special about it, except that it has dynamic storage for strings
with automatic garbage collection. I've reused those routines in several
other projects.
