T :Do you like to drink tea?
T :Please answer y (yes) or n (no)
A :
M :y
TY:Great! the following steps should be easy for you.
TN:That is O.K. This will teach you the steps in case you have a
  :guest who likes to drink tea.
T :Please type in your first name, and then press return to
  :continue
A :$name
T :Thank you $name.
  :Imagine that you are in an English cottage and you have just
  :decided to make a cup of afternoon tea.  The first thing that
  :you will do is:
  :
  :a. Pour hot water from the tap into a cup with a teabag?
  :b. Pour cold water into a kettle?
  :c. Pour cold water into a cup with a teabag?
  :
  :Please choose one of the options above, and press a, b, or c.
A :
M :b
TN:No, most people in England use cold water to heat up for tea.
  :
T :Now imagine that you have put the water on to heat.  Since "a
  :watched pot never boils", take five minutes to admire the view
  :from the cottage window.
  :
T :The water has heated for long enough. At what point will you
  :remove it from the stove?
  :
  :a. When it has heated for five minutes
  :b. When it is boiling, and there are bubbles in the water.
  :c. When it is lukewarm.
  :
  :Please answer a, b, or c
A :
M :b
T :
TY:That's right.  You must have boiling water to infuse tea
  :properly.
TN:No, that's not quite right.  Without boiling water tea tastes
  :like dishwater.
  :
T :Once the water has boiled you should heat the teapot before
  :putting in the tea and pouring the boiling water inside.  This
  :is more important with a ceramic teapot than one made of metal.
  :
  :Now that the tea-leaves are infusing, how long should you leave
  :them to brew?
  :
  :a. 1 - 2 minutes
  :b. 3 - 5 minutes
  :c. over 5 minutes
  :
  :Answer a, b, or c
A :
M :b
T :
TY:Correct. 3 to 5 minutes will bring out flavour without too
  :strong a taste.
TN:Sorry, 3 to 5 minutes will bring out the best flavour of the
  :tea.
T :Thank you, $name. I hope that you enjoy your cup of tea.
